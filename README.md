# Mapping_Earthquakes
For this project, many elements were added to a basic GeoJSON map. 
The map features 4 different types of maps, and 3 different data sets to show different changes that occur and where. This includes tectonic plates, earthquakes, and major earthquakes. The data can tell a lot to the viewer about a relation between major earthquakes and tectonic plate location.
